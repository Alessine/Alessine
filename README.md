<b>Hi, I’m Angela</b>

I'm currently working on the following projects:

- a movie recommender app using a fasttext model, deployed via Streamlit and AWS. 
- #TidyTuesday visualizations, because they're fun! :smile:

You can check out the repos for both of these just below. :point_down:

Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.
