### Hi, I’m Angela

I'm currently working on the following projects:

- a movie recommender app using a fasttext model, deployed via Streamlit and AWS. 
- #TidyTuesday visualizations, because they're fun! :smile:

You can check out the repos for both of these just below. :point_down:

I'm learning about:

- Data Science for Digital Marketing

Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.
