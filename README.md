### Hi, I‚Äôm Angela, a Digital Analyst

___________________________

I'm continuously working on projects to enhance my skills and understanding of data and the web. Here are some examples of things I've created:

- [automated visualizations](https://github.com/Alessine/recipevault) of over 20'000 life cycle impact assessment datasets from the ecoinvent database. üåç
- a [tutorial](https://medium.com/@angelaniederberger/automated-web-scraping-with-aws-72b7f80c2927) on how to automate a scraping job with AWS Free Tier (Code Refactor, S3, EC2). ü§ñ
- a [Flask Web App](https://github.com/Alessine/recipevault) integrating data from the Spoonacular API. :stew:
- [#TidyTuesday visualizations](https://github.com/Alessine/TidyTuesday-Visualizations), because they're fun! :smile: 

For things related to my participation in the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main) (2025 cohort) check this [repository](https://github.com/Alessine/data-engineering-zoomcamp).
