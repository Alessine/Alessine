### Hi, I’m Angela, a Digital Analyst

___________________________

I'm continuously working on projects to enhance my skills and understanding of data and the web. Here are some examples of things I've created:
- a [tutorial](https://medium.com/@angelaniederberger/automated-web-scraping-with-aws-72b7f80c2927) on how to automate a scraping job with AWS Free Tier (Code Refactor, S3, EC2) 🤖
- a [Flask Web App](https://github.com/Alessine/recipevault) integrating data from the Spoonacular API. :stew:
- [#TidyTuesday visualizations](https://github.com/Alessine/TidyTuesday-Visualizations), because they're fun! :smile:

I'm interested in exchanging about the use of data in media, digital subscriptions marketing and web programming. Get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-niederberger/).
